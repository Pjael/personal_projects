Finding important words in text using TF-IDF
turotial: https://stevenloria.com/tf-idf/

TF-IDF stands for "Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency." It's a way to score the importance of words (or "terms") in a document based on how frequently they appear across multiple documents.

Therefore, common words like "the" and "for," which appear in many documents, will be scaled down. Words that appear frequently in a single document will be scaled up.
