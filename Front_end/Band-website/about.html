            <p>The lastest released video is 'Flowers dressed in Blue'
            “The reason we made this band and the reason we make music, is to inspire people 
            to have an unquenchable fire for Jesus, and to live a REAL and UNDIGNIFIED life for him.
            And we want to remind everyone, that no matter the age no matter the background, 
            no matter what anyone says. God has created you in his image, and He wants to know you, 
            and He wants you to know Him.”
